  title: Stack Exchange Get User
  description: "Gets the users identified in ids in {ids}.\n \nTypically this method
    will be called to fetch user profiles when you have obtained user ids from some
    other source, such as /questions.\n \n{ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited
    ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.\n
    \nThe sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the user object:\n
    - reputation - reputation\n - creation - creation_date\n - name - display_name\n
    - modified - last_modified_date\n  reputation is the default sort.\n \n It is
    possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate,
    and todate.\n \nThis method returns a list of users."
